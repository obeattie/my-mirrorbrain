mirrorbrain (2.14.0-3) stable; urgency=low

  - 2nd attempt of linking the math library, to fix unresolved symbol "sqrt" in
    mod_mirrorbrain.so.

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Sat,  6 Nov 2010 06:59:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.14.0-2) stable; urgency=low

  - linking the math library, to fix unresolved symbol "sqrt" in
    mod_mirrorbrain.so.

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Sat,  6 Nov 2010 06:22:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.14.0-1) stable; urgency=low

  - update to 2.14.0 (r8210):
    http://mirrorbrain.org/docs/changes/#release-2-14-0-r8210-nov-6-2010
    - If the “GeoLite City” GeoIP database is used, MirrorBrain now uses 
      geographical distance as additional criterion to improve mirror selection
      in difficult cases (issue #34).
    - Per-file mirror lists are more readable and embed a link to a Google map 
      with mirrors.
    - When running behind a load balancer or other reverse proxy, prefix 
      detection (for containment in network prefixes of mirrors) did not work.
    - Experimental support for restricted downloads. See release notes.
    - Running behind authentication (e.g. Basic) is now supported.
    - zsync 0.6.2 compatibility has been tested.
    - Small code optimizations and cleanups.
    Upgrade notes: http://mirrorbrain.org/docs/upgrading/#to-2-14-0

mirrorbrain (2.13.4-1) stable; urgency=low

  - update to 2.13.4 (r8188):
    See http://mirrorbrain.org/docs/changes/#release-2-13-4-r8188-oct-19-2010
    mb scan:
    - The output of the scanner has been improved, by introducing a -q|--quiet
      option. Used once, only a summary line per scanned mirror will be shown. Used
      twice, no output will be produced except errors.
    - When a scan via rsync ran into a timeout, the name of the affected mirror was
      not reported. The error message was only “rsync timeout”, and while there
      normally were other messages giving a hint, output is now improved to include
      the mirror identifier.
    - When enabling a mirror after successful scanning, the scanner now makes sure
      that the mirror is not only marked “enabled” but also marked being “online”.
      Mirrors are normally marked online by the mirrorprobe (which is typically run
      once per minute), but it is much more logical when a mirror is really
      directly available after scanning with --enable.
    mb scan & mirrorprobe:
    - There was a case of a quirky web server software that ignores requests
      without Accept header. The mirrorprobe and the scanner now send an Accept
      header with value ‘/‘, because sending this header in general should not
      harm.
    geoip-lite-update:
    - This script now works on Ubuntu. It no longer relies on a command named ftp
      being capable of doing HTTP downloads, and prefers curl or wget if available.
    - The script is quiet now, producing no output if no error is encountered.
    Documentation was extended and enhanced.

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Tue, 19 Oct 2010 18:42:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.13.3-1) stable; urgency=low

  - update to 2.13.3 (r8166):
    See http://mirrorbrain.org/docs/changes/#release-2-13-3-r8166-sep-26-2010
    - The Magnet links embedded in Metalinks could cause the Metalink client
      aria2c to wait a long time on P2P connections, and not try the listed
      mirrors anymore (issue #73). These links are no longer included at the
      moment, unless MirrorBrainMetalinkMagnetLinks On is set in the Apache
      configuration.
    - Under certain conditions (transparent negotiation of metalinks),
      mod_mirrorbrain could deliver a file 'foo' when 'foo.bar' was requested but
      didnt exist. Found and fixed by Michael Schröder and closing issue #75.
    - When generating Torrents, the order of keys was not obeyed, which should be
      lexicographical. This is now the case, so the Torrents should be valid also
      for clients that insist on correct ordering. This should improve the
      compatibility to some clients, notably rtorrent. Tracked in issue 74 and
      issue 78.
    - The MD5 sum in Torrent info hashes was wrongly sent in binary form, instead
      of being hex-encoded. In addition, the key was wrongly named md5 while
      md5sum is the correct name. Fixing issue 77.
    - Not a bugfix, but a hopefully useful addition is that Torrents now contain
      a “created by” key, indicating the generator of the torrent, and the
      version number (e.g. MirrorBrain/2.13.3). Suggested in issue 65.

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Sun, 26 Sep 2010 03:39:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.13.2-1) stable; urgency=low

  - update to 2.13.2 (r8153):
    See http://mirrorbrain.org/docs/changes/#release-2-13-1-r8136-sep-18-2010
    mod_mirrorbrain:  
    - The content of the mirror lists (details pages) are now wrapped into a
      XHTML/HTML DIV container with id="mirrorbrain-details". This improves the
      possibilities for styling in conjunction with a stylesheet linked in via
      the MirrorBrainMirrorlistStyleSheet directive (issue #63).
    - Further individual design can now be achieved by specifying the XHTML/HTML
      header and footer which are placed around the page body instead of the
      built-in XHTML (issue #63). This is configured with two new Apache
      configuration directives.
    - Hashes can now be requested without a filename being included in the
      response, to simplify parsing (issue #68). This is done by sending the
      query string only_hash. This works with different ways to request a hash:
          http://host.example.com/foo.md5?only_hash
          http://host.example.com/foo?md5&only_hash
    - The filename in hashes can also be suppressed site-wide (and therewith, on 
      the server side) with a new Apache config directive
      MirrorBrainHashesSuppressFilenames On. It goes into virtualhost context.  
    - When sending out a hash to a client (as requested by appending e.g. .md5),
      there is now a double space between hash and filename – just like as the
      familiar tools like md5sum and sha1sum do it. This should avoid confusion
      and extra effort in parsing.
    - The mirror list’s content type header now comes with UTF-8 as character set,
      instead of ISO-8859-1, which should make more sense.
    mb export –format=mirmon:
    - update format (and documentation) for the current mirmon-2.3. (issue #62)

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Sun, 19 Sep 2010 20:28:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.13.1-1) stable; urgency=low

  - update to 2.13.1 (r8136)
    mb edit:
    - Fix a regression in 2.13.0, which made it impossible to remove an URL by
      setting it to an empty string. r8044 (fix for issue #30) was the culprit.
    mb scan:
    - Scanning lighttpd web servers is now supported. Thanks to patch contributed
      by Phillip Smith. This fixes issue #60.
    mb list/edit/show/...:
    - In some situations, the fuzzy-matching on mirror identifiers made it impossible
      to select certain mirrors. Phillip Smith not only reported this issue but
      submitted a clever patch at the same time, which keeps the convenient behaviour
      but also allows for selection mirrors by their full name. Fixing issue #61.

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Wed,  8 Sep 2010 02:01:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.13.0-9) stable; urgency=low

  - Try to fix the little breakage that occured after moving /usr/bin/mb from
    mirrorbrain-tools to python-mb on Debian/Ubuntu:
    - mirrorbrain-tools:
      Depends:python-mb (>=2.13.0)
    - python-mb:
      Breaks: mirrorbrain-tools (<<2.13.0)
      Replaces: mirrorbrain-tools (<<2.13.0)
  - The move of /usr/bin/mb from mirrorbrain-tools to python-mb wasn't done in
    the RPMs yet

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Tue,  7 Sep 2010 23:50:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.13.0-8) stable; urgency=low

  - user and group are now created automatically on installation
  - /var/log/mirrorbrain is included in the package now

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Tue,  7 Sep 2010 17:31:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.13.0-8) stable; urgency=low

  - update to (probably final) r8123
  - rsyncinfo.py renamed to rsyncinfo
  - install the bdecode tool

mirrorbrain (2.13.0-6) stable; urgency=low

  - update to r8115
    - The module now works also when the path in the <Directory> contains
      symlinks, fixing issue #17
    - Further documentation updates

mirrorbrain (2.13.0-4) stable; urgency=low

  - Don't force Python 2.5 on Ubuntu 10.04
    http://mirrorbrain.org/issues/issue6

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Fri,  3 Sep 2010 00:27:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.13.0-3) stable; urgency=low

  - Another bugfix for Debian Lenny / older (1.2) Apache Runtime: the format
    string %lld wasn't known yet at the time. So let's use APR_INT64_T_FMT
    which is defined in any case (ld on 1.2, lld on 1.3 and later). This
    fixes the mirror list and metalinks.

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Thu,  2 Sep 2010 16:36:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.13.0-2) stable; urgency=low

  - Bugfix for Debian Lenny:
    The old (1.2) Apache Runtime's PostgreSQL adapter didn't know the
    APR_DBD_TYPE_LONGLONG (%lld) format string yet, and preparation of SQL
    statements failed for this reason. This is fixed by using %d now with APR 1.2.

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Thu,  2 Sep 2010 16:00:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.13.0-1) stable; urgency=low

  - update to 2.13.0.
    (Release notes http://mirrorbrain.org/docs/changes/ w.i.p.)
  - remove requirement on the metalink package. Hashing is now done with
    Python/OpenSSL.
  - drop obsolete patches mirrorbrain-2.12.0-issue52.patch and
    mirrorbrain.diff (https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=602434)

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Wed,  1 Sep 2010 14:46:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.12.0-3) stable; urgency=low

  - add patch mirrorbrain-2.12.0-issue52.patch for 
    http://mirrorbrain.org/issues/issue52 (the match for client prefix/mirror 
    prefix should check for containment, not string match)

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Mon, 30 Aug 2010 13:31:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.12.0-2) stable; urgency=low

  - on Debian & Ubuntu, let the mirrorbrain-scanner package depend on the
    libtimedate-perl package. Thanks Christophe Vandeplas from fosdem.org for
    this fix.

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Sun, 21 Feb 2010 16:46:00 +0100

  - update to 2.11.3 (r7933):
    * null-rsync:
      - IO errors returned by rsync are handled now
      - remote errors from rsync are ignored now

    - -t 20 option removed from the mirrorprobe call, since it's the default now
    - hint about ulimits has been removed, which turned out to be a band-aid
      for a purely local problem.

    Details: http://mirrorbrain.org/docs/changes/#release-2-11-3-r7933-dec-16-2009

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Wed, 16 Dec 2009 16:57:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.11.2-1) stable; urgency=low

  - update to 2.11.2 (r7917):
    * mb scan:
      - Improvements in scanning over FTP (missed mirrors in subdirectory scans; 
        files with whitespace)
    * mb db (new command for database maintenance tasks):
      - mb db sizes - shows sizes of all relations
      - mb db shell - conveniently open a shell for the database
      - mb db vacuum - cleans up dead references (previously:
        The previous command, "mb vacuum", continues to work for the reason of
        backwards compatibility.
    * mirrorprobe:
      - default timeout lowered from 60s to 20s
    Details: http://mirrorbrain.org/docs/changes/#release-2-11-2-r7917-dec-5-2009

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Wed,  5 Dec 2009 21:51:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.11.1-1) stable; urgency=low

- update to 2.11.1 (r7899):
  * mod_mirrorbrain:
    - the compile time detection for APR < 1.3 was fixed. This affected Debian 
      and Ubuntu. Fixing issue #29.

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Wed,  3 Dec 2009 12:50:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.11.0-2) stable; urgency=low

  - update to 2.11.0 (r7896):
    * mod_mirrorbrain:
      - New feature: configure fallback mirrors via MirrorBrainFallback (see
        release notes: http://mirrorbrain.org/docs/changes/#release-2-11-0-r7891-dec-2-2009
      - use correct APR DBD API version semantics for row retrieval (issue #7)
      - the obsolete MirrorBrainHandleDirectoryIndexLocally directive has been removed
        (a warning issued where it is still found in the config)
      - The default of MirrorBrainHandleHEADRequestLocally has been changed to "off".
        This means in most cases, that the directive can be removed.
    * The documentation for installation on Debian Lenny was tested and corrected
      where needed. Credits to TheUni! 
    * mb:
      - Parse errors in the configuration file are not caught and and reported 
        nicely.
      - Special characters occurring in the configured password are escaped
        before passing them to SQLObject/psycopg2, thus fixing issue #27. A
        remaining issue is that double quotes can't be used... a warning is
        issued if it's attempted.
    * mb scan:
      - A warning that appeared since the last release has been removed. It was
        caused by the removal of obsolete code, and purely cosmetic.
    * null-rsync:
      - An --exclude commandline option has been implemented, to be passed
        through to rsync.
      - Control over the program output can now be exerted by the two new options
        --quiet and --verbose.
      - Usage info is implemented (--help etc.).
      - Interruptions by Ctrl-C and similar signals are intercepted now.
    * metalink-hasher
      - When comparing the modification time of a saved metalink hash with that 
        of a source file, the sub(sub-)second portion of the value could be
        different from the value that has just been set by os.ulimit().  (Quite
        surprisingly.) So now, we compare only the int() portion of the value.
        This fixed issue #24. 

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Wed,  2 Dec 2009 04:34:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.11.0-1) stable; urgency=low

  - Debian/Ubuntu: add postinstall/postrm script that load/unloads
    mod_mirrorbrain

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Tue,  1 Dez 2009 23:57:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.10.3-1) stable; urgency=low

  - update to 2.10.3 (r7871):
    * null-rsync:
      - new script: special rsync wrapper which creates a local file tree from a
        mirror, where all files contain only zeroes instead of real data. All
        files are sparse, modification times and sizes are fully copied,
        so that even (native) rsync thinks that the file tree is identical.
    * mb new:
      - when creating a new mirror, and detecting that the hostname resolved to
        multiple addresses (round-robin DNS), a warning about this fact was issued.
        Now, (short of documentaion in the manual) a reference to
        http://mirrorbrain.org/archive/mirrorbrain/0042.html is added, where the
        issue has been discussed in depth.
      - A proper error message is now shown if an identifier is chosen that already
        exists.
    * mb mirrorlist / mb marker:
      - The order in which mirrorlist columns are presented is now kept unchanged,
        so it appears as it was entered into the database.
      - The sort order of mirrorlist entries has been improved. Instead of the
        priority, the mirror operator name is now given precendence in order, which
        results in a mirror list that actually *looks* sorted.

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Wed, 28 Nov 2009 01:03:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.10.2-1) stable; urgency=low

  - update to 2.10.2 (r7853):
    Bug fixes:
    * When scanning a subdirectory, the mirror scanner (mb scan) could
      accidentally delete files from the database outside of that directory. This
      was caused by lack of terminatation (with a slash) of the path expression
      that is used to grab the list of known files before the scan. Herewith
      fixing issue #19.
    * The mirrorprobe could crash when the sender domain of a configured mail log
      handler wasn’t resolvable (issue #9). This has been fixed.
    * A misleading error message in the mb tool was improved, which was issued
      when encountering config file with missing sections.
    The documentation was updated in various places. Debian/Ubuntu installation
    instructions were added.

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Wed,  4 Nov 2009 17:41:00 +0100

mirrorbrain (2.10.1-5) stable; urgency=low

  * add patch to mod_mirrorbrain.c for incompatibility with APR < 1.3 (issue #7)
  * use Python 2.5 because python-sqlobject gives a deprecation warning with
    Python 2.6 (which is the default Python on Ubuntu 9.04) (issue #6)
  * patching is amateurishly done with sed from the rules file

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Thu,  8 Oct 2009 09:21:00 +0200

mirrorbrain (2.10.1-4) stable; urgency=low

  * properly package the python module (python-mb subpackage)

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Mon, 30 Sep 2009 14:53:00 +0200

mirrorbrain (2.10.1-3) stable; urgency=low

  * don't package scanner.pl twice (it didn't belong into the file list of mirrorbrain-tools)
  * package the mb (mirrordoctor) script

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Mon, 30 Sep 2009 09:41:00 +0200

mirrorbrain (2.10.1-2) stable; urgency=low

  * require python-cmdln, which is now packaged in the openSUSE buildservice
  * fix dependency on libaprutil1-dbd-pgsql (it's not called libapr-util1-dbd-pgsql)

 -- Peter Poeml <poeml@cmdline.net>  Mon, 30 Sep 2009 00:34:00 +0200

mirrorbrain (2.10.1-1) stable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release
    There are things missing: example config files are not packaged, and
    user/group isn't created yet. Dependencies are untested.
